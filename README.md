   # On Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install flatpak flatpak-builder
   flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
   flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Sdk//48 org.gnome.Platform//48
   ```

   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flatpak run io.github.Cookiiieee.WSelector
   ```

### Permissions

The application requests the following permissions for full functionality:

- `--filesystem=home`: Required for:
  - Creating and executing temporary scripts to set wallpapers
  - Accessing configuration files
  - Creating necessary directories
  
- `--filesystem=xdg-pictures:create`: For saving wallpapers to `~/Pictures/WSelector/`

- Network access: Required to fetch wallpapers from Wallhaven.cc

- Wayland/X11 sockets: For proper display integration

## üìÇ File Locations

- **Configuration**: `~/.var/app/io.github.Cookiiieee.WSelector/config/wselector/config.json`
- **Cache**: `~/.cache/wselector/` (thumbnails and temporary files)
- **Downloads**: `~/Pictures/WSelector/` (all downloaded wallpapers)
- **Logs**: `~/.var/app/io.github.Cookiiieee.WSelector/data/wselector/logs/` (debug information)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Wallpaper Setting Issues
If wallpapers aren't setting correctly:
1. Ensure the application has the necessary permissions
2. Check that your desktop environment is supported (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.)
3. Verify that the wallpaper directory exists and is writable
4. For Wayland users: Ensure `xdg-desktop-portal` is installed and running

### Performance Issues
If you experience any lag or stuttering:
1. Try reducing the number of concurrent downloads
2. Clear the thumbnail cache in `~/.cache/wselector/`
3. Restart the application to free up system resources

### Network Issues
If you encounter API errors:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify that Wallhaven.cc is accessible
3. The application implements retry logic for failed requests

## üéØ Tips & Tricks

- Use the mouse wheel to quickly scroll through wallpapers in preview mode
- Right-click on any wallpaper to access quick actions
- Press `Esc` to close the preview window
- The application automatically saves your search preferences and last viewed position
